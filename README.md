The following steps need to be done in order to run the test:

Open Visual Studio code

Open new project
->Click File-> Clone or Checkout code

Enter "https://github.com/Abcshake/JustEatTest.git" in Repository location and click Clone

In order to run the text, Chrome driver needs to downloaded to the local drive
I used Chromedriver v2.41 (any newer version should work)

Download it here: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.41/
Unzip the file and then save to local. Copy the path of the folder where chromedriver is saved 

Once my test code has been cloned in Visual Studio replace the path for the location variable to path of the Chromedriver in your local

Then right anywhere one the code and click "Run Tests" or click the green Run tests button on the top navigation Bar
